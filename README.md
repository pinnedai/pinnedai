## The 5-step value loop

1. **`pinned init`** scans your repo and creates baseline guards on install (auth checks, lockfile integrity, secret prefixes, route registrations, webhook signatures, URL literals, exports, form error-handling, more).
2. **Guard Integrity blocks** any commit that tries to delete, skip, weaken, or `--no-verify`-bypass a guard.
3. **AI Lessons file** (`.pinned/ai-lessons.md`) captures repo-specific rules — read by Claude / Cursor / Devin / Copilot before they edit.
4. **`pinned audit --learned`** scans sibling code paths for the same mistake pattern.
5. **Future AI edits must pass every guard.** The output of every finding is an executable test, not a review comment.

**Proof it works**: see the [`/proof` page](https://pinnedai.dev/proof) for benchmark results, or jump to [Status](#status) below for the headline numbers.

## Quickstart

```bash
# See what Pinned does on a sample claim — no install, no signup
npx pinnedai

# Install in your repo (one command)
npx pinnedai init

# After init, on every commit Pinned blocks AI bypass attempts and
# auto-protects new admin/middleware/webhook/client-fetch code.
```

`pinned init` writes `.github/workflows/pinned.yml`, creates `tests/pinned/` with `PINS.md`, installs pre-commit + pre-push hooks, auto-generates baseline pins from your current code, and seeds AI-coder rules into `CLAUDE.md` + `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (and any other AI rule file already in the repo). Each step prompts before writing in interactive mode; pass `--auto` to accept all.

If your repo already has `.cursorrules`, `.clinerules`, `AGENTS.md`, or `.windsurfrules`, init writes to those too — same marker-bounded block, identical uninstall flow (`pinned uninstall-agent-rules`).

## Editor + AI-tool surfaces

Pinned ships across every major AI-coder surface:

| Surface | What you get | How to install |
|---|---|---|
| **VS Code / Cursor / Windsurf / Codium** | `◆ pinned · N guards · ✓` in the status bar, rich hover tooltip with recent guards + latest AI lesson, click → Quick Pick (action chooser) → command runs in a Pinned-managed terminal. Works in stock VS Code (Copilot users), Cursor, Windsurf, Codium. | Bundled `.vsix` auto-installs during `pinned init` (until we publish to the Marketplace + Open VSX in v0.1.1) |
| **Claude Code** | Statusline + UserPromptSubmit hook (`◆ pinned · LEARNED · 1 new AI mistake`, transient block-event messages). Optional `/pinned-status`, `/pinned-list`, `/pinned-review`, `/pinned-done` slash commands. | Statusline auto-wired by `init`; slash commands via `npx pinnedai install-claude` |
| **GitHub Copilot Chat (free + paid)** | Reads Pinned rules from `.github/copilot-instructions.md` before generating code | Auto-created during `init` |
| **MCP-aware tools (Claude Desktop, Cline, Continue)** | `pinned_before_code_change`, `pinned_before_done_check`, `pinned_scan_diff`, `pinned_list_guards`, `pinned_check_pr_description`, `pinned_suggest_init` as native tools with structured `human_summary` + must-report `agent_instruction` fields | Add `pinnedai-mcp` to the tool's MCP config — see [docs/integrations/](./docs/integrations/) |
| **GitHub Action (CI)** | `pinned check-guard-removal` + vitest on every PR — guard weakening attempts fail CI | Auto-wired via `.github/workflows/pinned.yml` from `init` |
| **Pre-commit + pre-push hooks** | Block bypass attempts locally before they reach CI | Auto-wired by `init` |

## v0.2 templates (just shipped)

Three new templates for the contracts a real app actually wants pinned:

- **`page-renders`** — *"GET /path renders without crashing."* Catches React/Next/Vite render errors + 500 pages + broken SSR.
- **`validation-rejects-bad`** — *"POST /api/X with bad input returns 400."* Catches removed/weakened input validation. One pin, N sub-tests (malformed-JSON + per-field missing).
- **`happy-path-with-side-effect`** — *"POST /api/X creates a users record."* Catches stub endpoints returning 200 without doing the work (misleading-green) via the `X-Pinned-Side-Effect` response header convention.

`happy-path-with-side-effect` auto-fires on routes with these recognized write shapes (0.2.8+), both in new diffs AND retroactively on `pinned init` for existing handlers:

| Library | Pattern detected |
|---|---|
| supabase-js | `supabase.from("X").insert/update/upsert/delete` |
| prisma | `prisma.X.create/update/upsert/delete` (incl. `createMany` / `updateMany`) |
| drizzle-orm | `db.insert/update/delete(X)` (also `tx.insert(...)` inside transactions) |
| kysely | `db.insertInto("X")` / `db.updateTable("X")` / `db.deleteFrom("X")` |
| mongoose | `Model.create(...)`, `new Model(...).save()`, `Model.updateOne(...)` |
| raw SQL | `INSERT INTO X`, `UPDATE X SET`, `DELETE FROM X` inside `db.execute()` / `sql\`...\`` |
| resend / sendgrid / nodemailer / aws-ses / postmark | their send / sendMail / sendEmail methods |
| bullmq / inngest / generic queue | `queue.add()`, `inngest.send()`, `jobs.enqueue()` |

If your repo uses a write library not yet recognized, the pin won't auto-fire — open an issue with the import pattern. Adding a row is two regex lines.

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md#020--2026-06-02) for parser phrasings + the side-effect wrapper customers add.

## What Pinned protects

Pinned focuses on AI-prone failure modes:

- **Guard weakening** — `.skip()`, `.only()`, `xit()`, `.todo()`, `.skipIf(true)`, deleted tests, weakened assertions (`toBe(401)` → `toBeTruthy()`), `|| true`, `?? true`, `catch(() => true)`, `expect(true).toBe(true)` tautologies, commented-out `expect()`, `expect.assertions(0)`, early `return;` in test body.
- **Pinned-infrastructure tampering** — deletion of `tests/pinned/*`, `.github/workflows/pinned.yml`, `tests/pinned/.registry.json`, `.pinned/ai-lessons.md`, or sneaky rename-to-retired/ without the matching `.audit.json`.
- **Client / API mistakes** — missing `authHeaders()`, missing `credentials: "include"`, lost `if (!res.ok)` gates, removed 401/402/403 handling. Detected statically per file via path + pattern heuristics.
- **Auth / middleware regressions** — `requireAuth` / `requireAdmin` / middleware matcher coverage; the middleware-aware pin uses `middleware.ts`'s captured auth signature so removing the auth check fails the guard.
- **Route / export / reference integrity** — internal `<Link href="/foo">` / `navigate("/foo")` / `router.push("/foo")` that resolve today are pinned; if a future commit removes the target page file, the pin fails.
- **Webhook signature verification** — `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent`, `x-hub-signature-256`, `svix.verify`, `twilio.validateRequest`, generic `crypto.createHmac("sha256", ...)`. Pinned captures the verify call so removing it fails the guard.
- **Public exposure no-fixture checks** — `.env` committed without `.gitignore` coverage, `.map` files in `dist/`/`build/`, debug routes (`__debug`, `__test`, `debug.html`, `/admin/console`).

## AI lessons

Pinned writes repo-specific lessons to `.pinned/ai-lessons.md` (markdown for humans) and `.pinned/lessons.json` (structured for tools).

Each lesson is generated from a real event — a blocked bypass attempt, a replay-verified bug-fix guard, or a confirmed sibling audit. Dedupe is per `guardId`: repeat attempts append evidence to the existing entry, not duplicate sections.

Example:

```md
## Don't weaken client-getReport-authHeaders

<!-- pinned:guard=client-getReport-authHeaders kind=guard-block -->

**Past mistake:**
weakened: src/api/getReport.ts — `headers: await authHeaders()` removed in PR #88

**Rule:**
Do not remove `authHeaders()` from `src/api/getReport.ts`. Fix the application code instead.

**Guard:** `client-getReport-authHeaders`

**Plain English:** don't drop authHeaders() from API calls
```

Point your AI coder at this file with `pinned install-agent-rules` so Claude/Cursor reads the rules before editing.

## Commands

### Setup

```bash
npx pinnedai init                    # one-time per repo
npx pinnedai install-agent-rules     # opt-in: wire CLAUDE.md/.cursorrules/etc. to read .pinned/ai-lessons.md
npx pinnedai uninstall-agent-rules   # undo the above
npx pinnedai agent-rules             # show which agent files are wired
```

### Daily workflow

```bash
npx pinned test                      # run the pin suite
npx pinned status                    # see active pins + recent events
npx pinned context                   # print the AI-coder context (rules + lessons) for inline prompting
```

### Discovery

```bash
npx pinned scan-diff                 # show what Pinned would auto-protect in the current diff
npx pinned audit --learned           # scan sibling code paths for risks matching learned patterns
npx pinned probe-admin               # enumerate admin/internal routes + their protection state
npx pinned list                      # list all active + retired pins
npx pinned show <pin-id>             # what a pin asserts + what would make it fail (alias: `describe`)
npx pinned regenerate --all          # re-emit all pin .test.ts files using the current templates — run this after upgrading pinnedai to apply any template-bug fixes to existing pins (alias: `regen`)
```

### Lifecycle

```bash
npx pinned retire <claim-id> --reason="..."   # legitimate retirement (writes audit entry)
```

### Paid-API call pins (silent model swap / token-cap defense)

Pin every paid API call in your backend — not just the ones in Next.js Server Actions. Captures the call expression + model literal + `max_tokens` cap so AI silently swapping `claude-opus` → `claude-haiku` (quality regression) or removing the token cap (unbounded spend) is caught immediately.

```bash
npx pinned sweep          # auto-detects paid-API calls (Anthropic / OpenAI / Gemini / Stripe)
```

Coverage: Anthropic (`messages.create` / `parse` / `stream`), OpenAI (`chat.completions.create`, `responses.create`, `images.generate`, `embeddings.create`), Google Gemini (`generateContent`), Stripe (`paymentIntents.create`, `charges.create`, `subscriptions.create`, `customers.create`, `checkout.sessions.create`, `billingPortal.sessions.create`). Entry-point-agnostic — fires anywhere, plain backend service or Server Action.

### Supabase Edge Function pins (Deno runtime)

HTTP-route detection structurally misses Supabase Edge Functions (they run in Deno, not Node). Pin asserts the function file exists, the write expression survives, and the auth gate is preserved.

```bash
npx pinned sweep          # detects supabase/functions/<name>/index.ts
```

Catches: AI deletes the function ("dead code cleanup"), removes the write call, weakens the auth gate.

### Cron handler pins (Vercel + GitHub Actions)

Cron fires WITHOUT a user in the loop — schedule drift (`0 4 * * *` → `0 4 * * 0` runs once a week instead of daily) or handler rename = silent SLA break. Pin captures Vercel `vercel.json:crons[]` entries and GH Actions `on.schedule[].cron` schedules.

```bash
npx pinned sweep          # detects vercel.json + .github/workflows/*.yml
```

### Stripe webhook event-type dispatch pins

The layer above signature-verify. Catches AI silently typoing `case "checkout.session.complete":` (one-letter rename), merging fallthrough arms dropping one, or wholesale deleting a case. The signature still verifies — Stripe still returns 200 — paying customers never get provisioned.

### Server-Action pins (Next.js App-Router mutations)

Pin the App-Router mutation pattern that `/api/*` HTTP-route detectors can't see — auth-gated `"use server"` functions that perform DB writes, file uploads, or paid-API calls. Closes the highest-impact coverage gap reported via real-world dogfood.

```bash
npx pinned sweep                                                     # auto-detects Server Action writes
npx pinned record-server-action <claim-id> --fixture <payload.json>  # capture valid payload + regenerate test
```

Detection covers: supabase / prisma / drizzle / kysely / mongoose / raw SQL DB writes; supabase-storage / S3 / R2 / Vercel Blob file uploads; outbound paid-API calls (Anthropic / OpenAI / Gemini / Stripe). Auth-gate function name (`isAdminAuthed`, `requireAuth`, etc.) and zod input-schema name are captured automatically. Until you record a fixture, the pin self-skips with a clear message.

### Page accessibility pins (🛟 BETA — opt-in)

Catches the *"page renders but is unreadable"* class — white-on-white text, WCAG-AA contrast failures, invisible labels. Plain page-renders pins stay GREEN on these because the page does render; this is the only template that catches it.

```bash
npx pinned add-browser                  # one-time: install Playwright (~300 MB)
npx pinned sweep --include-beta         # auto-detects pages + emits axe-core pins
```

Loads each page via Playwright + injects axe-core (pinned version, CDN-loaded) + runs the `color-contrast` rule. WARN-only on violations (frontend a11y doesn't fail CI) + `confidence: "review"` so catches don't inflate the GA metric.

### Browser interaction pins (🛟 BETA — opt-in)

Cover frontend interaction regressions (the carousel "arrows do nothing" class) by wrapping Playwright. Beta posture: WARN-only on drift, attach-only to a running dev server, catches quarantined as `confidence:"review"` so they don't inflate the GA metric.

```bash
npx pinned add-browser                                # one-time: install Playwright + Chromium (~300 MB)
npx pinned sweep --include-beta                       # auto-detect interaction candidates + pin them
npx pinned record-interaction <claim-id>              # capture the baseline observation once
npx pinned record-interaction <claim-id> --dry-run    # observe without persisting (calibration)
```

Auto-detection finds buttons with stable selectors (`data-testid` preferred over `aria-label`) AND an `onClick` handler. Until you run `record-interaction`, the pin emits a single warn-only message; only after recording does drift get reported.

### Internal (called by hooks)

```bash
npx pinned check-guard-removal       # pre-commit hook entry; blocks AI bypass attempts
npx pinned statusline                # statusline rendering for Claude Code
npx pinned backtest --mode=bug-fix   # replay a repo's git history (calibration tool)
```

### Optional AI-assisted analysis (BYOK)

```bash
PINNEDAI_BYOK=openai PINNEDAI_OPENAI_KEY=sk-... npx pinned check
```

LLM-as-proposer fires on each commit's diff to suggest additional guards the deterministic detectors might miss. Customer pays their LLM vendor directly; Pinned doesn't proxy.

## Statusline

Pinned surfaces protection events without becoming a noisy reviewer. Events decay back to a calm baseline:

```
◆ pinned · 34 pins · 7 lessons · ✓ 12 verified                  # baseline
◆ pinned · 34 pins · ⚠ 2 protected files in this commit          # editing guarded files
◆ pinned · 34 pins · ⛔ blocked: AI weakened pin sample.test.ts   # Guard Integrity refused
◆ pinned · 34 pins · +1 new guard                                # SAVED
◆ pinned · 34 pins · scanned 3 similar files                     # AUDIT
◆ pinned · 34 pins · 4 guards passed                             # COVERED
◆ pinned · 34 pins · learned: don't drop authHeaders() from API calls  # LEARNED
◆ pinned · 34 pins · ✗ 1 broken                                  # failing pin
```

The `BLOCK / LEARNED / SAVED / AUDIT / COVERED` transients fall back to baseline after 1-2 minutes. Persistent value = guard count + lesson count.

---

## What Pinned is NOT

Pinned is **not** a generic code reviewer, SAST scanner, or AI bug-fixer.

CodeRabbit reviews PRs. Snyk / Semgrep scan for broad security issues. They run once and leave comments.

Pinned protects the repo-specific promises your AI coder must not forget: the bug fixes, guards, tests, and lessons that should survive future AI edits. **The output of every finding is an executable guard, not a comment.**

---

## AI and privacy

Pinned works **without an LLM**. The core engine is deterministic: guards either pass, fail, or were weakened.

Optional AI-assisted mode (BYOK) can propose additional guards, sibling audits, and lessons from diff context. AI output never enforces anything by itself — deterministic guards + CI do the enforcement.

Principle:

```
LLM proposes. Guards prove. CI enforces.
```

**Local-first.** Free beta runs entirely on your machine + your CI. Pinned doesn't see your code unless you set BYOK env vars (in which case the calls go directly to your LLM vendor, not through Pinned infrastructure).
